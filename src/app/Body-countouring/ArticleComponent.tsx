            <h3 className="clinic-feature">What is Body Contouring?</h3>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              Body Contouring is a collection of cosmetic procedures aimed at
              reshaping and sculpting the body to achieve a more proportionate
              and aesthetically pleasing figure. These procedures target areas
              such as the abdomen, thighs, buttocks, arms, and more, with the
              goal of enhancing body contours and achieving a more defined
              silhouette.
            </p>

            <h3 className="clinic-feature">Personalized Consultation:</h3>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              We begin the body contouring process with a comprehensive
              consultation to understand your specific goals, concerns, and
              expectations. Our experienced professionals will assess your body
              shape, discuss your desired outcomes, and develop a customized
              treatment plan to address your unique needs.
            </p>

            <h3 className="clinic-feature">Customized Treatment Plan:</h3>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              We believe in a personalized approach to body contouring. Based on
              your consultation, we will create a tailored treatment plan that
              combines the most effective procedures to help you achieve your
              desired results. This may include a combination of liposuction,
              non-surgical fat reduction, skin tightening, and muscle toning
              treatments.
            </p>

            <h3 className="clinic-feature">Advanced Techniques:</h3>

              Our body contouring treatments utilize the latest advancements in
              cosmetic procedures. We employ state-of-the-art techniques and
              equipment to ensure safety, precision, and optimal results. Our

            <h3 className="clinic-feature">Targeted Fat Reduction:</h3>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              If you struggle with stubborn pockets of fat that are resistant to
              diet and exercise, our body contouring procedures can help. We
              offer treatments that specifically target and eliminate excess fat
              cells, resulting in a more sculpted and contoured appearance.
            </p>

            <h3 className="clinic-feature">Skin Tightening and Toning:</h3>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              In addition to fat reduction, we also offer treatments to tighten
              and tone loose or sagging skin. These procedures stimulate
              collagen production, leading to firmer and more youthful-looking
              skin. We can address areas such as the abdomen, arms, thighs, and
              face to enhance your overall body contours.
            </p>
