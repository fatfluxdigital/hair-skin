            <h3 className="clinic-feature">What is PRP Therapy?</h3>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy is a revolutionary treatment
              that utilizes the healing properties of your own blood to
              rejuvenate your skin or stimulate hair regrowth. PRP is a
              concentrated serum derived from your blood, enriched with a high
              concentration of platelets and growth factors. These growth
              factors play a crucial role in the body's natural healing
              processes.
            </p>

            <h3 className="clinic-feature">How Does PRP Therapy Work?</h3>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              <strong>Consultation and Assessment:</strong> During your initial
              consultation, our experts will assess your specific concerns,
              discuss your goals, and determine if PRP therapy is the right
              option for you. We will explain the procedure in detail, answer
              any questions you may have, and ensure you have a clear
              understanding of the expected outcomes.
            </p>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              <strong>Blood Collection:</strong> A small sample of your blood
              will be taken, similar to a routine blood test, and processed in a
              centrifuge to separate the platelet-rich plasma from other
              components of the blood.
            </p>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              <strong>PRP Application:</strong> The extracted PRP, which
              contains a high concentration of growth factors, will be carefully
              applied to the targeted area. For skin rejuvenation, it may be
              injected directly into specific areas or applied topically. For
              hair regrowth, it is injected into the scalp in areas of thinning
              or balding.
            </p>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              <strong>Stimulating Healing and Regrowth:</strong> The growth
              factors present in the PRP work to stimulate collagen production,
              improve skin texture and tone, promote tissue regeneration, and
              encourage the growth of new hair follicles. Over time, you will
              notice improvements in the quality of your skin or the regrowth of
              thicker, healthier hair.
            </p>

            <h3 className="clinic-feature">Benefits of PRP Therapy:</h3>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              <strong>Skin Rejuvenation:</strong> PRP therapy stimulates
              collagen production, which can improve skin elasticity, reduce
              fine lines and wrinkles, and enhance overall skin quality. It can
              also help with issues such as acne scars, sun damage, and uneven
              skin tone.
            </p>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              <strong>Hair Regrowth:</strong> PRP therapy can be highly
              effective in stimulating dormant hair follicles, promoting hair
              regrowth, and increasing hair thickness and density. It is
              suitable for both men and women experiencing hair thinning or
              early-stage baldness.
            </p>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              <strong>Natural and Safe:</strong> PRP therapy utilizes your
              body's own growth factors, reducing the risk of allergic reactions
              or adverse side effects. It is a safe and minimally invasive
              treatment option.
            </p>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              <strong>Long-lasting Results:</strong> PRP therapy provides
              gradual and natural-looking results that can be long-lasting.
              Regular maintenance treatments may be recommended to sustain the
              benefits.
            </p>
