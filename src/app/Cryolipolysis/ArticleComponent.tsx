            <h3 className="clinic-feature">What is Cryolipolysis?</h3>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              Cryolipolysis is a non-surgical body contouring treatment that uses controlled cooling to freeze and destroy fat cells. It is based on the principle that fat cells are more susceptible to cold temperatures than surrounding tissues. By subjecting the targeted area to precise cooling, cryolipolysis triggers a natural fat elimination process, gradually reducing the thickness of the fat layer and improving body contours.

            <h3 className="clinic-feature">Our Approach:</h3>
            <h4 className="clinic-feature">Personalized Consultation:</h4>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              We begin with a comprehensive consultation to understand your specific goals, concerns, and desired treatment areas. Our experienced professionals will assess your body composition, discuss your expectations, and determine the most suitable cryolipolysis treatment plan for you.
            </p>

            <h4 className="clinic-feature">Customized Treatment Plan:</h4>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              Based on your consultation and desired outcomes, we will develop a customized treatment plan tailored to your individual needs. We will identify the target areas for fat reduction and recommend the number of sessions required to achieve optimal results.
            </p>

            <h4 className="clinic-feature">Cryolipolysis Procedure:</h4>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              During the treatment, a specialized applicator is applied to the target area, delivering controlled cooling to the underlying fat cells. You may experience a sensation of intense cold initially, which typically subsides within a few minutes as the area becomes numb. The procedure is comfortable, and many patients use the time to relax, read, or catch up on their favorite shows.
            </p>

            <h4 className="clinic-feature">Natural Fat Elimination:</h4>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              Following the cryolipolysis procedure, the targeted fat cells undergo a natural elimination process known as apoptosis. Over the following weeks and months, your body will gradually metabolize and eliminate these fat cells. You will notice a reduction in fat thickness in the treated area, leading to a more contoured and sculpted appearance.
            </p>

            <h4 className="clinic-feature">Long-lasting Results:</h4>
            <p className="clinic-feature-description">
              Cryolipolysis offers long-lasting results. Once the fat cells are eliminated, they do not regenerate. However, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and a balanced diet, is important to preserve your new body contours.
            </p>
