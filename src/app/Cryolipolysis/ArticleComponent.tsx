      <h3 className="clinic-feature">What is Cryolipolysis?</h3>
      <p className="clinic-feature-description">
        Cryolipolysis is a non-surgical body contouring treatment that uses
        controlled cooling to freeze and destroy fat cells. It is based on the
        principle that fat cells are more susceptible to cold temperatures than
        surrounding tissues. By subjecting the targeted area to precise cooling,
        cryolipolysis triggers a natural fat elimination process, gradually
        reducing the thickness of the fat layer and improving body contours.
      </p>

      <h3 className="clinic-feature">Our Approach:</h3>
      <p className="clinic-feature-description">
        <strong>Personalized Consultation:</strong> We begin with a
        comprehensive consultation to understand your specific goals, concerns,
        and desired treatment areas. Our experienced professionals will assess
        your body composition, discuss your expectations, and determine the most
        suitable cryolipolysis treatment plan for you.
      </p>
      <p className="clinic-feature-description">
        <strong>Customized Treatment Plan:</strong> Based on your consultation
        and desired outcomes, we will develop a customized treatment plan
        tailored to your individual needs. We will identify the target areas for
        fat reduction and recommend the number of sessions required to achieve
        optimal results.
      </p>
      <p className="clinic-feature-description">
        <strong>Cryolipolysis Procedure:</strong> During the treatment, a
        specialized applicator is applied to the target area, delivering
        controlled cooling to the underlying fat cells. You may experience a
        sensation of intense cold initially, which typically subsides within a
        few minutes as the area becomes numb. The procedure is comfortable, and
        many patients use the time to relax, read, or catch up on their favorite
        shows.
      </p>
      <p className="clinic-feature-description">
        <strong>Natural Fat Elimination:</strong> Following the cryolipolysis
        procedure, the targeted fat cells undergo a natural elimination process
        known as apoptosis. Over the following weeks and months, your body will
        gradually metabolize and eliminate these fat cells. You will notice a
        reduction in fat thickness in the treated area, leading to a more
        contoured and sculpted appearance.
      </p>
      <p className="clinic-feature-description">
        <strong>Long-lasting Results:</strong> Cryolipolysis offers long-lasting
        results. Once the fat cells are eliminated, they do not regenerate.
        However, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, including regular exercise and
        a balanced diet, is important to preserve your new body contours.
