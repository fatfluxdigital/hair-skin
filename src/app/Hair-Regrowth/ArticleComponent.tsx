            </p>

            <ul className="treatment-options">
              <li>
                Low-Level Laser Therapy (LLLT): LLLT utilizes safe and painless
                laser technology to stimulate blood circulation in the scalp,
                rejuvenating hair follicles and promoting hair growth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Platelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) Therapy: PRP therapy involves using
                your body's own growth factors, extracted from your blood, to
                stimulate hair follicles and promote hair regrowth.
              </li>
              <li>
                Hair Transplantation: For individuals with more advanced hair
                loss, we offer hair transplantation procedures that involve
                transplanting healthy hair follicles from donor areas to areas
                with thinning or no hair. This procedure provides permanent and
                natural-looking results.
              </li>
              <li>
                Medications and Topical Treatments: We may recommend
                FDA-approved medications, such as finasteride and minoxidil, or
                specialized topical treatments to slow down hair loss and
                promote regrowth.
